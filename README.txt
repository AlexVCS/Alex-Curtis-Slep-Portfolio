### Setup

If you'd like to run this project on your local machine, a terminal and editor (I use VS Code) of your choice would make things easier.

1. Click the green code button:

</p>

2. From there, click the button to the right of the URL under HTTPS. This will copy the URL of the repository.

3. Then open your terminal or command line. If you haven't used the command line before [learn how to here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics).

4. If you've got a folder where you keep projects, change directories into that folder. After that type this command:

```git clone https://github.com/AlexVCS/Alex-Curtis-Slep-Portfolio.git```

This clones the repository to your local machine. It has a root directory called `Alex-Curtis-Slep-Portfolio` to store all the files.

5. Change directories into that folder:

```cd Alex-Curtis-Slep-Portfolio```

After that you can open the project in your text editor of choice. I use Visual Studio Code and launch it from the command line. [Learn how here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).

6. You can open the index.html file to run this project or use a live server extension like [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
